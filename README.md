# Project Abstract

Chonko should be in powerpoint

# Project Description

The goal of our application is for a user to be able to put scheduled events into a calendar as well as times when they would like to do social activities. The user then can add tasks that need to be completed during daily life and the userâ€™s tasks will be added to the calendar during available time slots. Finally, the social aspect is that the user will be recommended things to do during their social times, such as concerts, restaurant deals, and fitness classes. In addition, the user will be able to add friends and recommend that they participate in activities with them.

# Budget

We have yet to spend any money yet, however we are aware that we will need an apple developer liscense ($100) which is used to get our app on the apple store. Additionally we will be cloud hosting a server on either AWS or azure which will cost some money (~$50-\$75 depending on how long we host it).
