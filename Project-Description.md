# Project Problem

Today’s youth have a hard time juggling many things going on including scheduling classes, assignments, activities, and social gatherings. We would like to make an application that makes this simple and easy.

# Inadequacies of the current solutions

Today, Google Calendar and some enterprise software’s do similar things to our application when it comes to auto scheduling. The current issues we see are that the applications do not add a social aspect to them, and their scheduling algorithms are not very good and could use some more customization.

# Project Description

The goal of our application is for a user to be able to put scheduled events into a calendar as well as times when they would like to do social activities. The user then can add tasks that need to be completed during daily life and the user’s tasks will be added to the calendar during available time slots. Finally, the social aspect is that the user will be recommended things to do during their social times, such as concerts, restaurant deals, and fitness classes. In addition, the user will be able to add friends and recommend that they participate in activities with them.
