This repository contains the code for the main application of my senior design project. It's written in Python 3 using standard libraries (e.g. PIL, tkinter).

The master branch is the final version of the code, which is meant for the Raspbian OS on a Raspberry Pi. The windows_branch is the previous version of the code, which was written on a Windows 10 computer. The windows_branch will be retained for testing purposes.
