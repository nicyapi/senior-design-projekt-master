# Project Description
The goal of our application is for a user to be able to put scheduled events
into a calendar as well as times when they would like to do social activities.
The user then can add tasks that need to be completed during daily life and the
userâ€™s tasks will be added to the calendar during available time slots. Finally,
the social aspect is that the user will be recommended things to do during their
social times, such as concerts, restaurant deals, and fitness classes. In
addition, the user will be able to add friends and recommend that they
participate in activities with them.


# User Interface Specification (optional inclusion of UI design)

# Test Plan and Results (describe execution and results of all tests)
In the backend, our main testing strategy is to make unit tests for almost
everything we write. We have installed pytest as our testing framework. The
backend uses a test database that is used when tests are run and all artifacts
from testing are completely removed between every test.

In the frontend, our plan is to test core UI/UX functionality. This will mean
simple front end navigation tests as well as in-def end to end test for getting
results from the back end.
