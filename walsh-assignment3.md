# Assignment 3

For our senior design project, we are making a self-scheduling calendar. This calendar will also include a social media aspect that allows users to easily plan things to do with friends. There are other products out there that help users schedule their lives automatically. However, they do not have the social aspects that our application will. This project will allow our team to expand our knowledge and understanding of many technologies, such as Google Calendar and Reactjs. The project will focus on developing our skills application and cloud development.

Throughout my college experience I have learned a lot that will help me with developing this application. From classes I have learned important concepts from my networking, requirements engineering and python courses. Networking will be applied when we connect the application to the server securely. Requirements engineering has taught me the skills necessary to come up with a proper project plan, which will help us work efficiently. Python will help us develop the back-end server and allow us to easily and securely communicate with our database and Google. There are other things that I have learned from courses like Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence that I am sure will be used, but we have not determined how at this moment.

More importantly then our course work I have learned a lot during my CO-OP experiences. I have developed so many skills from CO-OP that will help with this project and it would be impossible to discuss them all. At Siemens I learned the fundamentals of full stack development and software analytics. The skills I learned at Siemens which will help me develop a good user interface and experience. At DFIN I worked in cloud development and honed my skill in full stack development. The skills I learned at DFIN will help us create and effective and working back end.

Not only is this project something that I believe in, but it is an excellent opportunity to test my skills, challenge myself and learn some new things along the way. Theis projects origins come from an idea that I had 5 or 6 years ago now. I have done a few basic self-scheduling calendars since I had the idea, but I know that we can make a massive improvement to the earlier versions. The addition of the social media aspect to this application is what truly excites me. I genuinely believe that this application could be popular if executed properly. It will be difficult, but I really think that we can make something great.

Our Initial approach is to divide the work into front end and back end. Nick will be working on the back end and I will be working on the front. This will allow us to work quickly two get both pieces working. The issue with this plan is that it requires a high level of communication and planning, otherwise the 2 pieces will not work together well. Our first steps will be to develop requirements and map out our APIs for this reason. If we do this properly, I believe that it will save us time when we get to the point of hooking up the application to the server. Hopefully, if we work effectively, we will be able to get feedback on our application by distributing it for use by our friends in the coming months.
